            <h2>What is FreshSense?</h2>
            <p>FreshSense is a simple, easy-to-use system that “smells” the air inside mushroom farms. Imagine a small device, about the size of your hand, quietlyworking in the corner of a grow room. It reads the air every second, looking forunusual odors that may signal problems such as mold, bad bacteria, or issueswith the growing material.Once FreshSense detects something unusual, it sends a quick alert to thefarmer’s phone. This means the farmer can take action right away—long beforethe problem becomes visible.FreshSense acts like a “nose that never sleeps,” helping farmers protect theirharvest 24 hours a day.</p>
